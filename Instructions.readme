-----------------------------------



Arguments are not case-sensitive. Settings below can be modified, but in case I forgot to minify it, please don't edit below where it says to

!!RECOMPILE AFTER PASTING IN DRONE!!


Construction guide:
   1. Have a programmable block
      - This must be placed in the correct orientation; the screen should be facing the rear of the drone.
      - Make sure to edit any configs BEFORE placing all your drones! They won't share all of their data.
         - Formation distances are synchronized from controller to drone.

   2. Have thrusters and gyros

   3. Have an antenna
      - Range, name, and hudtext is not important. Just have an antenna on the grid.
      - Make sure to protect it! This is the second most important block, other than the programmable block.

   4. Have a controller ship
      - Set the 'isController' bool in the configs to true on the controller (or set this PB's customdata to "-1")
      - Make sure it has an antenna too!

   5. Shoot people (optional)
      - These drones are nearly as stupid as Aristeas, so treat them as blind deaf and dumb.
